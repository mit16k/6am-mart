Order Flow (Happy Path)

The customer places an order from a store (can’t place an order from multiple stores at a time)
The delivery boys get that order in the order request section and accept it for delivery.
After the delivery man’s confirmation (If turn on the delivery confirmation model), the store owner gets the order on their dashboard and starts processing or cooking, and handover the items to the delivery boy.
If the order is digitally paid the order will directly go into the confirmed status and the store gets the order on their dashboard (will not depend on the delivery boy’s confirmation).
If the admin turn on the store’s confirmation model then for both case no need the delivery man’s confirmation but after stores, confirmation delivery men will get the order for acceptance. 
The Delivery Guy accepts the order, confirms the order (if COD), picks up the order, and delivers the order to the Customer.
If self-pickup orders, the stores will manage all the steps.
For scheduled orders, all the operations will start before 15 minutes of the scheduled delivery time.
